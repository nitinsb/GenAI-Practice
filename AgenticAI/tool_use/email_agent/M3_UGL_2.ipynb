    "\n",
    "In an earlier video in this module, Andrew showed the example of a calendar assistant that could use multiple tools to carry out complex tasks. In this ungraded lab, you‚Äôll explore a similar example - working with an **email assistant agent**. \n",
    "\n",
    "This agentic workflow can carry out various tasks related to email management, including sending emails, searching for emails from a specific sender, and deleting emails. You‚Äôll give it natural language instructions - like ‚Äúcheck unread emails from my boss‚Äù or ‚Äúdelete the Happy Hour email‚Äù - and see how it selects the right tools and completes the task for you.\n",

    "This lab uses a **simulated email backend** to mimic real-world email interactions.\n",
    "Think of it as your personal sandbox email inbox: it comes preloaded with messages so you can practice without sending real emails.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of building this backend from scratch, you‚Äôll be using tools that let you interact with it directly. Behind the scenes, it uses:\n",

    "| Layer                   | Purpose                        |\n",
    "|-------------------------|--------------------------------|\n",
    "| **FastAPI**             | Exposes REST endpoints         |\n",
    "| **SQLite + SQLAlchemy** | Stores and queries emails locally |\n",
    "| **Pydantic**            | Ensures inputs and outputs are valid |\n",
    "| **AISuite tools**       | Bridge between the LLM and the service |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Endpoints\n",
    "The service provides several routes that simulate common email actions.  \n",
    "Later on, these will be wrapped as tools so the assistant can use them automatically:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `POST /send` ‚Üí send a new email  \n",
    "- `GET /emails` ‚Üí list all emails  \n",
    "- `GET /emails/unread` ‚Üí show only unread emails  \n",
    "- `GET /emails/{id}` ‚Üí fetch a specific email by ID  \n",
    "- `GET /emails/search?q=...` ‚Üí search emails by keyword  \n",
    "- `GET /emails/filter` ‚Üí filter by recipient or date range  \n",
    "- `PATCH /emails/{id}/read` ‚Üí mark an email as read  \n",
    "- `PATCH /emails/{id}/unread` ‚Üí mark an email as unread  \n",
    "- `DELETE /emails/{id}` ‚Üí delete an email by ID  \n",
    "- `GET /reset_database` ‚Üí reset emails to initial state (for testing)  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> üí° **Key idea:** These endpoints act as the ‚Äúinbox controls.‚Äù  \n",
    "> In the next steps, you‚Äôll expose them as Python functions (tools) that the LLM can call‚Äîturning raw routes into agent actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Endpoint test helpers\n",
    "Before giving control to the LLM, you‚Äôll first **test the backend yourself**.  \n",
    "The `utils.test_*` functions are quick wrappers around the API endpoints. They let you try actions like **send, list, search, filter, mark, and delete** without writing raw HTTP requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "_**Note:** find the utils.py file from the top menu by navigating to File > Open_\n",
    "\n",
    "Each helper has a clear, self-explanatory name. In the next cell code, you can uncomment the one you want to run, check their output, and confirm that the email service behaves as expected.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you can test:  \n",
    "- Send a test email  \n",
    "- Fetch email by ID  \n",
    "- List all messages  \n",
    "- Mark email as read or unread  \n",
    "- Delete email  \n",
    "\n",
    "This step is your **sanity check** before handing the controls over to the agent. It gives you confidence that the simulated email service is alive and behaving just like a real email service would.\n",
    "\n",
    "üëâ To test the endpoints, **uncomment** the lines you‚Äôd like to try out, run the cell, and check the results instantly."

    "- In this ungraded lab, **you explored** how an LLM email agent interacts with a simulated email service using tool calls.\n",
    "- **Tool calling** allows LLMs to go beyond text generation‚Äîenabling them to call functions (tools) and complete multi-step tasks.\n",
    "- The set of available tools determines what the agent can and cannot do (e.g., without `delete_email`, it cannot remove messages).\n",
    "- Clear docstrings and consistent behavior help the LLM select the right tool for each step.\n",
    "- AISuite manages the interaction layer: exposing Python functions as tools, accepting parameters, making API requests, and returning results.\n",
    "- Observing the full workflow‚Äîfrom prompt ‚Üí tool calls ‚Üí outputs ‚Üí final response‚Äîis key to understanding and improving how agents reason and act."

When a tool is missing, the agent can reason but cannot act; when it‚Äôs present, it can chain steps, pass parameters, and deliver exactly what you asked for. Along the way, AISuite handled the plumbing: schema exposure, argument binding, execution, and result passing‚Äîso you could focus on what you wanted done, not how to wire it up.\n",
